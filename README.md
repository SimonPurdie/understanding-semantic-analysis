## 🚀 Quick Start (Recommended)
The easiest way to run this notebook is via Google Colab. This avoids the need to install Python or libraries locally.

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/SimonPurdie/understanding-semantic-analysis/blob/master/Understanding%20Semantic%20Analysis.ipynb)

1. Click the **Open in Colab** button.
2. Go to **Runtime** > **Run all**.
3. The notebook will automatically install `sentence-transformers` and `scikit-learn` in the cloud environment.

## 📖 What's Inside
This notebook provides a hands-on guide to extracting meaning from text. Key concepts covered include:
* **Sentence Transformers**: Using the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model to encode text.
* **Vector Embeddings**: How computers turn language into "positions" in space.
* **Cosine Similarity**: Comparing the direction of vectors to determine similarity in meaning.
* **Sentiment Classification**: Categorizing reviews as Positive or Negative based on "anchor" phrases.
